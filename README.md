## Game Overview

Santorini is a two player strategy board game where players play on a 5 Ã— 5 standard chessboard, and each
player has 2 pieces. In this version of the game, player one's pieces are placed in the locations: (1,1) and
(2,5), and player two's pieces are placed in the locations (4,1) and (5,5).

First, each player chooses a piece type: either cube or pyramid, with no constraints on their picking. Both
of the player's pieces have to be of the type that he/she chose. We'll explain the difference between the 2
types in what follows...

The 2 players alternate turns: each turn a player must move one of their 2 pieces a distance of 1 vertically
or horizontally (if you're a cube type), or diagonally (if you're a pyramid type), then they must must place
a tile next to the location of the piece that's just moved.

The tile is to be placed 1 distance away from the piece's new location on unoccupied locations only.
Each placed tile increases the height of that location by 1 up to a maximum of height 3. Players can only
move to unoccupied location that are maximum 1 level higher (any level lower is okay). Additionally, players
can place domes on unoccupied 3-levels high locations in  the same way that they place tiles, that move
essentially destroys that location, preventing any piece from stepping in there.

A player wins if they move one of their pieces to a 3-levels high location or if the opponent cannot
move.

The following is a link to a video showing an explanation of the game that shouldn't differ too much from the above: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmPzVjdweYI#t=0m59s

## Features
A fully-featured Santorini 2-player or vs-Computer game programmed using Java with simple but appreciable
graphic assets, also featuring 3 levels of AI difficulty.

The game is really fun to play either with the AI or a friend, so make sure to try it!
